                <h4>Disc Golf Party</h4>
                <p>
                    For my master’s theis I pitched an idea for a mobile application surrounding disc golf. 
                    Through 20 weeks of user research, ideation and user testing I created "Disc Golf Party". 
                    At the end of the project in June 2022, I launched the app myself on the Google Play Store. By the end of July I also put out an 
                    iOS release on the App Store. The app has since then collectivly gotten over 2000 downloads. If you are a fan of disc golf 
                    you should totally check it out! 
                     
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DiscGolfParty.com.unity.android">Google Play</a>.
                    <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/disc-golf-party/id1636441401">App Store</a>.
                </p>

                <div class="hidden" id="hidden-1st">
                    <p>
                        The idea behind the app was two years in the making by the time I pitched the idea to disc golf company Latitude 64°. 
                        I wanted to explore disc golf from a different angle and see if a gamified, party variant of the sport could bring something
                        new and fun to the sport in general. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To summarize, I worked through the Lean UX cycle to iterate and test ideas. Aside from a research study, to better understand
                        gamification and motivation, I gathered over 900 responses for a survey that laid the foundation for the project as a whole.
                        Ten user tests were conducted in total, with each user test consisting of groups of 3-5 people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being the culmination of my education, I wanted the project to result in something more than just a prototype.
                        By the end of the project, Disc Golf Party was near completion and with a few finishing touches I launched the app 
                        as a solo developer on Google Play in June 2022. By the end of July I also decided to launch on the App Store for iOS.
                        Since then I have stayed in touch with the community and the app's users. 
                        The project is still alive and I continously make updates and use user feedback to improve the app as a whole.

                <h4>Alumni Network</h4>
                <p>
                    Umeå University's alumni section asked for inspiration to kickstart their work on their new Alumni Network.
                    We worked in a team of four and through polls, testing and interviews we made a design mock-up of the new Alumni Network page.
                </p>

                <div class="hidden" id="hidden-2nd">
                    <p>
                        The old alumni network at Umeå University were really getting out dated and we got the chance to inspire and come up with
                        ideas of how the alumni section at Umeå University could evolve into something new.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We worked in a group of four and we started out by gathering data through interviews and surveys.
                        The data was later used in brainstorming sessions as cornerstones to create a mock-up for a new alumni network.
                        The focus for this project was in understanding the design process and it taught me the value of pausing, to really 
                        understand what probelm we, as designers, are trying to solve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When working on similar projects on my own before, I have had a bad habit of getting stuck on different ideas.
                        Working creatively in a team really helped me to be more open minded.

                <p>
                    A project course surrounding the Lean UX cycle had us partnering up with local tech 
                    companies arround Västerbotten. Me, toghether with 4 fellow students teamed up with 
                    Once Upon Publishing AB to create a mock-up for a desktop version of their product.

                <h4>My Portfolio</h4>
                <p>
                    I made this portfolio as a part of a web design course held at Stockholm University.
                    This project mainly highlights the basics of web design and web developent. Everything was written from scratch with basic 
                    HTML, CSS and Javascript. For some of the functions I played aroun with jQuery as well.
